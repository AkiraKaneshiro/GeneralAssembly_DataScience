Data Explorers
===========================

These are my submissions to the Data Explorer assignments given in General Assembly's Python for Data Science Class.

Data Explorer 1

A primer for the assignments. No true analysis done. The aim was to get a ballpark figure of the cost of a house in Chicago based on the cost of other Chichago houses.

Data Explorer 2

This involved working with a subset of the data from Kaggle's Africa Soil Challenge to try to predict the pH of a given soil sample.
