Data Explorers
===========================

These are my submissions to the Data Explorer assignments given in General Assembly's Python for Data Science Class.

Data Explorer 1

A primer for the assignments. No true analysis done. The aim was to get a ballpark figure of the cost of a house in Chicago based on the cost of other Chichago houses.

Data Explorer 2

This involved working with a subset of the data from Kaggle's Africa Soil Challenge to try to predict the pH of a given soil sample.

Data Explorer 3

For this Data Explorer the data set was financial data from Bloomberg. The goal was to predict the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield (the interest rate paid on U.S. Treasury debt) based on the information given. The question to be answered was:

“Today the price of oil is $89/gallon. If OPEC acts to restrict supply it will do so to defend a $100 price floor. What effect will this $11.00 price change have on U.S. 10-year Treasury yields?”

Data Explorer 4

The aim of the assignment was to build a model to predict the onset of diabetes using scikitlearn’s inbuilt dataset (sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes).

Data Explorer 5

The goal of this assigment was to carry out NLP (Natural Language Processing) and sentiment analysis on tweets.

Data Explorer 6

This is a web scraping and categorization exercise. The web scraping component involved getting data for every Grateful Dead concert from 1972 to 1993 from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./gdead/setlists.html. The next goal was to answer interesting questions such as building a model to predict which decade a show was from based on the songs played, and to visualize the data.

Data Explorer 7

Here we worked with live Ebola data and did analysis on it. 

Data Explorer 8

This Data Explorer on was recommendation systems and giving out recommendations based on brand data.

Data Explorer 9

This was an assignment on A/B testing.
